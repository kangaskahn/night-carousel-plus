# Owl-Carousel-Plus v1.0.0
### Owl Carousel WordPress Plugin
#### By Matt Vona

---

[Owl Carousel](https://github.com/OwlCarousel2/OwlCarousel2) is a simple jQuery slider that lets you create a beautiful, responsive carousel slider. This WordPress plugin comes with functionality that will allow you to add a slide easily anywhere, each with custom settings.

The shortcode currently has 1 argument that is necessary for it to function correctly:

`[owl-slider-plus carousel="name-of-owl-slide-carousel-slug"]`

For instance, if you had a carousel titled Home:

`[owl-slider-plus carousel="home"]`



Initial release, I hope to add more features soon!

This plugin currently uses Owl Carousel v2.1.0
