# Owl-Carousel-Plus v1.1.1
### Owl Carousel WordPress Plugin
#### By Matt Vona

---

[Owl Carousel](https://github.com/OwlCarousel2/OwlCarousel2) is a simple jQuery slider that lets you create a beautiful, responsive carousel slider. This WordPress plugin comes with functionality that will allow you to add a slide easily anywhere, each with custom settings.

## Shortcode
The shortcode currently has 1 argument that is necessary for it to function correctly:
- `carousel` Slug of carousel you want to appear.

Example:
`[owl-slider-plus carousel="home"]`

## Carousel Options
Owl Carousel has many [options you can see here](https://owlcarousel2.github.io/OwlCarousel2/docs/api-options.html).

## Template
Owl Carousel Plus comes with a way to edit the output of each slide. The HTML can be customized exactly how you want it! The template field uses a system of variables to help with editing:

- `{{title}}` The title of the slide.
- `{{content}}` The content of the slide.
- `{{excerpt}}` The excerpt of the slide.
- `{{id}}` The Post ID of the slide.
- `{{featured-image}}` Returns the URL of the featured image.
